I used to blog, mainly about ConTeXt, but occasionally about other stuff as
well. My blog was hosted on
[Wordpress](https://randomdeterminism.wordpress.com) and it has been almost
three years since I last posted there. A lot of things have happened in the
interim, both in my professional and personal life. I enjoyed writing the blog
and my posts on ConTeXt were reasonably popular; but after a while using the
wordpress platform to write posts was a bit annoying. I am try to start
blogging again; this time using a [Hugo], which is a static website generator.

There are many available themes for blogging with Hugo. I tried a few of them
but did not like any of the existing themes. They were all too complex for my
taste. So, I am attempting to create my own theme. So, at present, this blog
does not have all the bells and whistles of a typical blog. I'll work on
these features as time permits; but my hope is that not having to worry about
the formatting anoyances of wordpress, I'll be able to keep the blog going for longer.

For old times sake, I have imported some of my old posts to this blog. If I am
in the mood, I might import a few others as well.
