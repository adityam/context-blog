I used to blog on [Wordpress], mainly about ConTeXt, but occasionally about
other stuff as well. If has been almost three years since I last posted
there. I got busy. Both in my personal and professional life. This is an
attempt to restart that blog.

I used to enjoy writing and some of my posts got a lot of traffic. However, I
found the Wordpress platform annoying. I am a terminal+vim sort-a-guy, and
found writing content on a textarea to be frustating. So, this time around, I
am using a static website generator---[Hugo].

[Wordpress]: https://randomdeterminism.wordpress.com
[Hugo]: http://gohugo.io

Many themes are available for blogging with Hugo, but I find them too
complicated for what I plan to do. So, I decided to create my own theme. I am
still trying to learn Hugo, so this blog lacks many of the features that you
associate with a typical blog. I'll use this barebones structure for a while
and see if I miss any of the features. 

For old times sake, I have imported some of my old posts to this blog. I
might import a few others, if time permits.
