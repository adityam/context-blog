I used to blog, mainly about ConTeXt, but occasionally about other stuff as
well. My blog was hosted on
[Wordpress](https://randomdeterminism.wordpress.com) and it has been almost
three years since I last posted there. A lot of things have happened in the
interim, both in my professional and personal life. I enjoyed writing the blog
and my posts on ConTeXt were reasonably popular; but after a while using the
wordpress platform to write posts was a bit annoying. So, as I attempt to
start the blog again, I am using a [static website
generator](http://gohugo.io). Hopefully, without having to worry aobut the
minor annoyances of wordpress, I'll be able to keep the blog going for longer
this time around.
