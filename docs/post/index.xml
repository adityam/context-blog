      <description>I used to blog, mainly about ConTeXt, but occasionally about other stuff as well. My blog was hosted on Wordpress and it has been almost three years since I last posted there. A lot of things have happened in the interim, both in my professional and personal life. I enjoyed writing the blog and my posts on ConTeXt were reasonably popular; but after a while using the wordpress platform to write posts was a bit annoying.</description>

      <title>Metapost and TeX labels</title>

      <description>Default Metapost has the concept of two types of labels, postscript labels and TeX labels. Postscript labels are created using
label(&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;, location);  while TeX labels are created using
label(btex text etex, location);  In the latter case, Metapost collects everything between btex and etex in a separate file, processes that file through TeX, and includes the resulting postscript code at an appropriate location. Such a Golberg-esque mechanism is needed to propertly typeset mathematics, get proper kerning, etc.</description>

      <description>Did you always want to learn ConTeXt, but did not know where to start? I have written a git-based tutorial that should help you get started.
The idea of the tutorial is to start with an empty document, and add features one-by-one. Each git commit corresponds to one small change in the document, and includes pointers to the documentation corresponding to that change. Read Use this tutorial as follows:

      <description>TeX has a steep learning curve. Often times, steeper than it needs to be. Take, for example, the special characters in TeX. Almost every introduction to plain TeX, eplain, LaTeX, or ConTeXt has a section on these special characters
\ { } $ &amp;amp; # ^ _ &amp;amp; ~  A good introduction then goes on to explain why these special characters are important; sometimes dropping a hint about category codes.</description>
