      <title>Include multi-page PDF</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As an academic, I often have to write letters and grant applications where I
need to need to prepare a single PDF which includes the letter or the grant
application with one of more research papers &amp;ldquo;attached&amp;rdquo; at the end. In
principle, I could generate the letter/grant separately and use a tool such as
&lt;code&gt;qpdf&lt;/code&gt; to merge multiple files into a single file. But I find it much easier
to generate everything from a single tex file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adjust spacing in itemize environments</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/context-blog/post/spacing-in-itemize/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was working on a LaTeX doc and needed to adjust spacing around the
LaTeX itemize environment. I wanted a list of item with no space before the
list environment and the list of items, no space between the items, but space
after the environment. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.texfaq.org/FAQ-complist&#34;&gt;TeX FAQ&lt;/a&gt; has a summary of how to adapt
spacing around itemize environment in LaTeX. Reading that made me appreciate
the control provided by ConTeXt. So, I thought that it is worthwhile to show
that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Finding the meaning of a command</title>

      <description>ConTeXt has a nice command to find a meaning of a command. Sometimes the easiest way to find the meaning of a macro is to simply use
\show\macroname In LMTX, context defaults to running with --batchmode, which means that you then have to hunt for the output of \show in the console output.
ConTeXt comes with a nice script to simply get the meaning of a macro on console.
$ mtxrun --script interface --meaning &amp;lt;macroname&amp;gt; For example:</description>

      <title>PDF with embedded video on linux</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/context-blog/post/pdf-embedded-video-on-linux/</link>

      <guid>https://adityam.github.io/context-blog/post/pdf-embedded-video-on-linux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I occassionally give presentations where the presentation must include
embedded videos. I typically include the movie using&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Statement&#34;&gt;\externalfigure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Delimiter&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;movie.mov&lt;span class=&#34;Delimiter&#34;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;height=..., width=..., preview=yes, repeat=yes&lt;span class=&#34;Delimiter&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I could not find any reliable method to play such movies in
linux. So, whenever I needed to make a presentation with embedded video, I
would take out a rusty 9 year old Macbook and lug that around. Not anymore!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating a clean presentation style in 40 commits (redux)</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/context-blog/post/presentation-40-commits-redux/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;link rel=&#34;stylesheet&#34; href=&#34;../../css/atom-one-light.css&#34;&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;../../js/highlight.pack.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back, a had created a &lt;a href=&#34;../presentation-40-commits&#34;&gt;git based tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for learning how to
create a presentation style in ConTeXt. I chose a git based style so that it
was easy to see what changed in each commit and what effect did the change
have on the output. But it is cumbersome to work with, especially if you are new
to ConTeXt as well as git.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>t-vim: A tale of two editors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I am looking at merging a few pull requests for &lt;code&gt;t-vim&lt;/code&gt;, I thought that
this will also be a good time to implement a simple feature that was on hold
for a while: the ability to use the module with &lt;a href=&#34;https://neovim.io/&#34;&gt;Neovim&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New escape mechanism for t-vim</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/adityam/filter/blob/master/vim-README.md&#34;&gt;t-vim&lt;/a&gt; module has been on a maintenance only mode for while, so I am
happy to announce a release which adds a new feature: a new method to escape
to TeX using &lt;code&gt;/BTEX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/ETEX&lt;/code&gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Formatting numbers in Lua</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often use Lua to generate solution for homework assignments. Ideally, I want
the solution to look exactly how it would look if it were written by hand. But
this can be tricker than it appears at first glance. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll
explain the issue and how I solve it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A new key-value interface for Metapost</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, Hans &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mail-archive.com/ntg-context@ntg.nl/msg91818.html&#34;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new key-value driven interface for MetaFun and
posted a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pragma-ade.com/general/magazines/mag-1104-mkiv.pdf&#34;&gt;MyWay document&lt;/a&gt; illustrating its use. In this post, I am going to
present an example of how to use this interface.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Designing cover page for an exam</title>
      <link>https://adityam.github.io/context-blog/post/exam-coverpage/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our university has a specific style that courses need to use as a cover page
for exams, shown below. They circulate a Word template at the beginning of
each term. Since I typeset my exams in ConTeXt, I decided to translate this
cover page template to ConTeXt as well. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I went
about doing this translation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
