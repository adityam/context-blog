<h1>Moving course website to quarto</h1>
<p class="post-time">Posted on April 23, 2023</p>

<p>For some years now, I have been maintaining the course notes for my graduate course as a <a href="https://adityam.github.io/stochastic-control/notes/">website</a> rather than a PDF document. I started with handwritten course notes the first time I taught the course, and then I typed them up in ConTeXt the next year. However, I wanted to add interactivity to my notes and that was not possible with PDF. (Technically, it is possible using Javascript, but Javascript in PDF has very limited support). So I experimented with maintaining my notes as a website and have been doing so for multiple years now.</p>
<p>Overall, it has been a pleasant experience. I used <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> as a static website builder, which can use pandoc to convert markdown to HTML. The math is rendered by MathJax, and for the most part, the math typesetting is okay. However, I find that the overall typesetting of my website is not nice; in part because I am not too familiar with CSS + Javascript.</p>
<p>On a whim, I decided to try using <a href="https://quarto.org/">quarto</a>, which is a framework built on pandoc to convert a single source to multiple output formats. I don&rsquo;t really need multiple output formats, but I decided to test quarto because the results look nice. A tested by converting a <a href="https://adityam.github.io/course-notes/">few pages</a> and am impressed by the output. Most of the improvement in the look-and-feel is because quarto uses <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> behind the scenes. I could perhaps have done the same by using a bootstrap theme with my original website, but as I said, I am not familiar with CSS + Javascript. Quarto appears to be very well thought out, so I don&rsquo;t see a reason to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>One of the features of quarto is the ability to embed computations. This is similar to what I do in a lot of my ConTeXt documents using the <a href="https://github.com/adityam/filter">filter</a> module. Amongst other languages, quarto can embed <a href="https://observablehq.com/">observable cells</a> as well. To me this is a big deal. A few years ago, I had experimented with different means to embed interactive widgets in HTML: geogebra, plotly, and observable. And observable provided the nicest experience.</p>
<p>However, one drawback was that the observable notebook is separate from markdown source. But with quarto, I can keep the observable code as part of the the same source, so it makes everything more portable. Yay!</p>
<p>I am also quite satisfied with the speed (both for compiling and rendering) as well as the quality. Look at a few examples: <a href="https://adityam.github.io/course-notes/stochastic-control/stochastic-optimization/newsvendor.html">the newsvendor problem</a> and <a href="https://adityam.github.io/course-notes/stochastic-control/mdps/gambling.html">optimal gambling</a> and judge for yourself.</p>
