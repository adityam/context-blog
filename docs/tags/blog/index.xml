      <description>I used to blog, mainly about ConTeXt, but occasionally about other stuff as well. My blog was hosted on Wordpress and it has been almost three years since I last posted there. A lot of things have happened in the interim, both in my professional and personal life. I enjoyed writing the blog and my posts on ConTeXt were reasonably popular; but after a while using the wordpress platform to write posts was a bit annoying.</description>
