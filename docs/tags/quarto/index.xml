      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some years now, I have been maintaining the course notes for my graduate course as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://adityam.github.io/stochastic-control/notes/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; rather than a PDF document. I started with handwritten course notes the first time I taught the course, and then I typed them up in ConTeXt the next year. However, I wanted to add interactivity to my notes and that was not possible with PDF. (Technically, it is possible using Javascript, but Javascript in PDF has very limited support). So I experimented with maintaining my notes as a website and have been doing so for multiple years now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
