      <description>&lt;p&gt;Posters are not or rather were not too common in my research field, so I have&#xA;never really had a need to create posters. But this is now changing and every&#xA;now and then, we have to make a poster presentation. I have looked at the&#xA;different options available for creating posters (see, for example, this&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/341/323&#34;&gt;TeX.SE&lt;/a&gt; post) but I find all of them&#xA;to be boring. Given that poster sessions are crammed, it is important to&#xA;create a poster that is visually distinct. So, when it came time to create a&#xA;poster for a paper that we will be presenting at &lt;a href=&#34;https://fwn06.housing.rug.nl/necsys2018/&#34;&gt;NecSys&#xA;2018&lt;/a&gt; next week, we started looking&#xA;at something visually distinct. Inspired by a &lt;a href=&#34;http://monanews.info/best-poster-presentation-template/&#34;&gt;template&lt;/a&gt; that my co-author,&#xA;Mohammad, found, we created the poster shown below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
