      <description>I occassionally give presentations where the presentation must include embedded videos. I typically include the movie using
\externalfigure[movie.mov][height=..., width=..., preview=yes, repeat=yes] Unfortunately, I could not find any reliable method to play such movies in linux. So, whenever I needed to make a presentation with embedded video, I would take out a rusty 9 year old Macbook and lug that around. Not anymore!
 A couple of months ago, I came across pdfpc, which is a presenter console with multi-monitor PDFs.</description>
