      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our university has a specific style that courses need to use as a cover page
for exams, shown below. They circulate a Word template at the beginning of
each term. Since I typeset my exams in ConTeXt, I decided to translate this
cover page template to ConTeXt as well. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I went
about doing this translation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Posters are not or rather were not too common in my research field, so I have never really had a need to create posters. But this is now changing and every now and then, we have to make a poster presentation. I have looked at the different options available for creating posters (see, for example, this TeX.SE post) but I find all of them to be boring. Given that poster sessions are crammed, it is important to create a poster that is visually distinct.</description>

      <description>Did you always want to learn ConTeXt, but did not know where to start? I have written a git-based tutorial that should help you get started.
The idea of the tutorial is to start with an empty document, and add features one-by-one. Each git commit corresponds to one small change in the document, and includes pointers to the documentation corresponding to that change. Read Use this tutorial as follows:
